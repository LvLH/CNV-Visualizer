# TODO

* have to add parser to `getParser()` in `featureFileReader.js`
* have to implement `parseFeatures(data)` in `cnvParser.js`
* need to define an exact format for the data
    * needs to at least have `feature.start` and `feature.end`, maybe
      `feature.chr` too?
    * very similar to `segParser.js`
